But getting to this point, and actually launching it, was not an easy journey.</p> <p>Nate has a real passion for WordPress and is especially skilled at building complex plugins that meet a user's unique needs. He also enjoys mentoring and sharing his knowledge and is equally comfortable in client-facing and technical roles. Learn about Nate's development experience and his new plugin at November's WordPressRI Meetup. </p> <p><br/>WordPress RI Meetups are held consistently on the 2nd Tuesday of every month. More details about this month's Meetup will be posted soon - in the meantime, keep up with the latest on Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressri\">@WordPressRI</a></p> <p>We look forward to seeing you!</p> ",
